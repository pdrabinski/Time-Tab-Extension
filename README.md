# New Tab Chrome Extension

The purpose of this project was to practice JS, HTML, and CSS through building a chrome extension. The extension displays time on the new tab page and links to a page where you can play tic tac toe against the computer.

The game page is very basic, but I'm leaving it as is for now because the goal was to just get a working game. 

The tic tac toe game could also use some improvements. Chiefly, the computer could use a better strategy. Currently, I'm pursuing this outside of the constraints of an extension, but hope to bring it back to this project.
