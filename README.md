# New Tab Extension to Display time

Chrome extension that displays time on new tab page. 

There is also a link to a page where you can play tic tac toe against the computer. The computer's logic is simply to put its piece down in the next available spot. My goal is to add more rules to the computer's game play, but I'm currently pursuing this outside of the constraints of an extension. 

The game page needs a few improvements, but I'm leaving this as is for now because the goal was to just get a working games. In the future though, I hope to remove the ability to overwrite moves and add a few more features.
